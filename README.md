# Pattern-Based Number Printing

## Overview

This repository contains Python scripts to print numbers from 0 to 9 using patterns created with the `*` character. The patterns are designed using only loops and conditionals, adhering to a consistent approach to represent each digit in a 7x5 grid. The project begins with basic pattern examples and progresses to detailed patterns for each digit.

## Pattern-Based Printing

### Starting from Basics

The project begins with simple pattern examples to demonstrate the use of loops and conditionals for printing shapes. These basic patterns lay the groundwork for more complex patterns representing numbers.

### Patterns for Numbers 0 to 9

The following scripts illustrate how to print each digit from 0 to 9 using loops and conditionals. Each digit is represented in a 7x5 grid pattern with balanced horizontal and vertical lines.

- **0:** A script to print the digit 0 with `*` characters forming a closed loop.
- **1:** A script to print the digit 1 with `*` characters forming a vertical line.
- **2:** A script to print the digit 2 with `*` characters forming the top, middle, and bottom lines along with diagonal connections.
- **3:** A script to print the digit 3 with `*` characters forming top, middle, and bottom lines with vertical sides.
- **4:** A script to print the digit 4 with `*` characters forming the vertical lines and middle horizontal line.
- **5:** A script to print the digit 5 with `*` characters forming the top, middle, and bottom lines with vertical sides.
- **6:** A script to print the digit 6 with `*` characters forming the top, middle, bottom lines, and vertical sides.
- **7:** A script to print the digit 7 with `*` characters forming the top horizontal line and diagonal lines.
- **8:** A script to print the digit 8 with `*` characters forming balanced horizontal and vertical lines.
- **9:** A script to print the digit 9 with `*` characters forming top, middle, bottom lines with vertical sides and additional diagonal connections.

## Running the Code

To run the provided scripts:

1. Save the desired code in a file named `print_digit.py` (replace `print_digit` with the corresponding digit function, e.g., `print_eight.py`).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the Python file is located.
4. Execute the script using Python:
5. The output will display the pattern for the corresponding digit in the console.
